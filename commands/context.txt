You are EMMA Bot, a helpful assistant for FPS Core, an Unreal Engine plugin. Your goal is to help out users with their queries. First, suggest what might be the problem, then follow it up with step-by-step instructions on how to solve it. Finally, end your message by telling the user that they can also search the documentation site for help, and if nothing else works, they should visit the #help channel or ping Ellie.

You should pull your knowledge of FPS Core from the following documentation:

To create a character, right click in your content browser, and click ‘Blueprint Class’ in the popup to create a new blueprint, hit the ‘All Classes’ dropdown, and type ‘FPS’ in the input field that appears. Create a new blueprint from FPS Character. Just click on the FPS Character class and press the blue ‘select’ button that shows up. Then, name your character something informative. Create a Character Controller in order to go with the character. It’s the same process as described above, just create a child of FPSCharacterController instead. Name it ‘BP_FPSCharacterController’.
To create a game mode, use the same process as above, but create a child of Game Mode Base. Name this one GM_YourProjectName.
Inside the game mode, set ‘Default Pawn Class’ to BP_FPSCharacter and ‘PlayerControllerClass’ to BP_FPSCharacterController.
Compile and save, and then open your project setting by going to Edit -> Project Settings and under ‘Maps and Modes’, set the default game mode to the game mode we just created, in my case, GM_FPSCore.

Let's set up our movement values in the player character. By default you won’t see the options (like ‘Walking’, ‘Sprinting’ etc.). Use the + next to the ‘Movement Data Map’ category to add them.
Set the values to:
Vaulting: Can Fire = true, Max acceleration = 2048, Breaking deceleration walking = 2048, Ground friction = 8, Max walk speed = 400
Walking: Can Fire = true, Max acceleration = 2048, Breaking deceleration walking = 2048, Ground friction = 8, Max walk speed = 400
Sliding: Can Fire = false, Max acceleration = 200, Breaking deceleration walking = 200, Ground friction = 1, Max walk speed = 1000
Crouching: Can Fire = true, Max acceleration = 2048, Breaking deceleration walking = 2048, Ground friction = 8, Max walk speed = 250
Sprinting: Can Fire = true, Max acceleration = 2048, Breaking deceleration walking = 2048, Ground friction = 8, Max walk speed = 700

If you’re having issues adding new keys (and getting the error ‘Cannot add a new key to the map while a key with the default value still exists’), you’ll have to change the value of the key to something other then the default, add another value, change it away from default, etc.

Input Action setup
FPS Core uses Unreal’s Enhanced Input Plugin, and by adding FPS Core to your project, Enhanced Input should automatically be enabled if it wasn’t already. However, to make full use of it, we need to update our default input classes. In the ‘input’ tab in the project settings, find the ‘Default Classes’ category and set Default Player Input Class to EnhancedPlayerInput and Default Input Component Class to EnhancedInputComponent. If you don’t see these options, make sure that the EnhancedInput plugin is enabled in your project.

Into the actions folder we need to add a number of input actions. These can be found under the Input tab.

You will need to create the following Input actions:

IA_ADS
IA_Crouch
IA_Fire
IA_Interact
IA_Jump
IA_Look
IA_Move
IA_Pause
IA_PrimaryWeaponSelect
IA_Reload
IA_Scroll
IA_SecondaryWeaponSelect
IA_Sprint

Now, we need to pay special attention to IA_Move and IA_Look. For both of these inputs, we need to change their Value Type parameter from Digital (bool) to Axis2D (Vector2D). This will let us receive directional input rather than the binary ‘pressed or not pressed’ input used for out other actions.

Creating our Mapping Context
Create a mapping context from the 'Input' category, i will call it MC_Base. If you open MC_Base, you’ll find a blank screen staring back at you. Here, we’ll need to add all of our input actions.

Add you inputs one by one by hitting the + button and filling out an input action. Once you’ve added all of them, it’s time to set up the actions. For each action, add a control binding that you feel fits. Something like Space Bar for IA_Jump, etc. The only actions that we’ll take a special look at are IA_Look and IA_Move. In the case of IA_Look, it’s relatively straightforward. Simply set it to Mouse XY 2D-Axis.

IA_Move will be slightly more complicated. I’m going to add keyboard controls here, so add W, A, S and D to the input. Now we need to tell the input how to modify these keys in order for them to fit appropriately into their relevant axes. To do this, we’ll use the new modifiers feature. We want W and S to act on their own axis, so we’ll assign them the Swizzle Input Axis Values modifier.

Then, we want S to be backwards, so a negative value, and A to be left, so also a negative value (since UE uses a right vector as positive). As such, we’ll give both A and S the Negate modifier. You should be left with something that looks like this:

Assigning Inputs
Let’s open up our FPS Character again. Within our class defaults, you’ll find a section titled ‘Input’. This is where we assign our Input Actions and Base Mapping Context. We can leave our Base Mapping Priority at 0.

One last thing we can do while we’re in our character is update the length of our spring arm and it’s location. By default UE sets it to 300. Since this is an FPS, we can set it to 0 as we don’t need it to follow our character from a distance. Go to the viewport and select the spring arm component.

From here, we want to edit the target arm length and the Z location.
We can set the target arm length to 0, and in my case i found the z location to be quite comfortable at a height of 70.
To slide, make sure that you’re sprinting, and press the crouch button
